In simple terms it let's you share code with others without passing a flashdrive back and forth. Benefits of Git include:<ul><li>Easily see changes and figure out where conflicting changes happenned.</li><li>Don't rely on a central server. With Git everyone has a copy of the code and its history.</li><li>Make the changes you want and branch off into a new feature or even a new project(forking)</li><li>A robust community of developers who have helped to put 95% of the questions you'll ask on Stack Overflow</li></ul></p>While Git is an awesome tool, it can be hard to understand when you're just starting out. Git Sandbox is here to help you understand Git with an interactive and visual tool along with links to other great Git resources.</div><div id="Remotes"><h2>Remotes and how you interact with them</h2><p>Remotes are a very important part of Git if you want to interact with others. Git can work without access to these remotes, and is NOT accessing remotes normally. Changes that happen on remotes are generally accessed via 'git-fetch' or git-pull' and changes can be applied to a remote with 'git-push'. Note that you might not have access to change a remote. In these cases you'll typically make a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">Pull Request</a> so others can add your changes to the remote.</p><p>To view what remotes your repo has you can run 'git remote' or 'git remote --verbose' if you want to see the path or url to the remote.</p></div><div id="GitObjects"><h2>Git Objects: blobs, trees, and commits</h2><p>For those that want to understand the inner workings of Git there is a brief explanation of blobs, trees, and commits here. If you're content with Git being a blackbox, then feel free to skip this section.</p><p>Git objects are stored in '.git/objects'. The names are a mix of 40 characters, 0-9,a-f. These are the sha-1 hashes of the different objects. Don't worry about collisions too much though as there 16^40 unique hashes, and even in the largest repos objects can be identified by the first 12 characters of their hash. Did I mention that when you do need to reference an object you don't need to use the whole hash? Git will figure out the desired object given a unique starting substring so don't worry about typing 40 odd characters only to get an error when you press enter.</p><p>Blobs, the content of the files. Git acts differently than older VCS by tracking the content of the files separately from files. Blobs are a binary version of a file's contents with the name of this file being the hash of the file contents.</p><p>Trees, the structure. Trees are the directories of Git objects. They provide the names of files and directories inside the repo and the contents via a blob or tree of that file or directory respectively.</p><p>Commits, the history of what's occurred. Commits point to trees (the root of the git repo), but are also responsible for storing the time they were created, who made them, and other metadata. All of these factors come into play when creating the ID of a commit, meaning that no two commits should have the same hash.</p></div></div><!--terminal divs--><div id="shell-panel"><div id="shell-view"></div></div></div></div><script>window.currentSnippet = "whatIsGit";
